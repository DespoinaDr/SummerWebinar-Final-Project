My first MVC web app with C# in ASP.NET.
I have chosen to work with C# and MVC. The project is about Summer Webinars, where users (students and teachers) can sign up by selecting their role. 
After signing up, each user logs in and sees a different page depending on their role. On their page, teachers can go to "My Webinars" to declare which programming language or framework they will teach.
On the same page, they can also edit the webinars they have already created after registering one or more seminars. 
On the students' page, tables with the seminars and teachers are displayed as derived from each teacher's entry.
